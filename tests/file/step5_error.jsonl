According to legend, vacationers picked up the tiny crocodilians in Florida, brought them home to New York, and eventually flushed the little buggers when they grew too big for the local concrete jungle.\nClues and the reasoning process: Clue 1: The input involves a story about alligators in New York. \nReasoning: This clue suggests that the topic may involve tourism, as the alligators were allegedly brought to New York by vacationers.\nClue 2: The alligators were rumored to roam the city's sewer systems. \nReasoning: This clue suggests that the topic may involve urban infrastructure and development, as the sewer systems are a key part of any city.\nClue 3: The alligators were allegedly brought to New York by vacationers. \nReasoning: This clue suggests that the topic may involve business, as the vacationers likely had to purchase tickets and lodging to visit New York. \nConclusion: The topic is likely Business.\nTOPIC: Business\n\nINPUT: When two become one Rivalry between the Dutch and British has a long history. Between 1652 and 1672, three wars broke out between two seafaring nations separated by trading interests as well as a few miles of North Sea.\nClues and the reasoning process: 1. The input mentions the Dutch and British, two nations separated by trading interests. This suggests that the topic may be related to business and commerce. \n2. The input mentions that three wars broke out between the two nations in a period of twenty years. This suggests that the rivalry between the two nations was likely related to business and trade and not political or military matters. \n3. The input also mentions that the two nations were separated by a few miles of the North Sea, indicating that their rivalry was likely related to maritime trade. \nTherefore, the topic is likely related to business and commerce.\nTOPIC: Business\n\nINPUT: The Bag of Aeolus  quot;Aeolus was keeper of the winds.
