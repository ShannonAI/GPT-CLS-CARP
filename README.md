## Overview 

In this paper, we introduce Clue And Reasoning Prompting (CARP), which is a progressive reasoning strategy tailored to addressing the complex linguistic phenomena involved in text classification.
* CARP first prompts LLMs to find superficial clues (e.g., keywords, tones, semantic relations, references, etc), based on which a diagnostic reasoning process is deduced for final decisions. 
* To further address the limited token issue, CARP uses a fine-tuned model on the supervised dataset for kNN demonstration search in the in-context learning, allowing the model to take the advantage of both LLMâ€™s generalization ability and the task-specific evidence provided by the full labeled dataset. <br>
 
Examples of prompts under zero-shot and few-shot (k=1) settings are shown in the following: <br>

## Setup Environment

Before running this project, you need to create a conda environment and install required packages. <br>

```bash 
conda create -n gpt-env python=3.7
conda activate gpt-env
pip install torch==1.8.1+cu111  torchvision==0.9.1+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
cd GPT-CLS-CARP
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```

After that, please execute the following commands in the terminal for downloading NLTK's dependent files.

```bash 
$ conda activate gpt-env
$ python3 
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```
